// Perform a tag search: query for documents which have the address_city field set to "Lisbon". Note that we use curly braces around the tag. Also note that even though the field is called address_city in the hash, we can query it as city. That's because in the schema definition we used the ... AS fieldname ... construct, which allowed us to index address_city as city.
